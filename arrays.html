	<p>Arrays are a special type of list-like variable. Being able to organize data in a JavaScript array offers
		developers a lot of power and flexibility with their applications. This week we will look at how to leverage
		this very interesting type of variable.</p>

	<script>
		var output = document.querySelector('body p:nth-of-type(2)');
		//console.log(output);	
		/* STEP 1: Creating an array
		When declaring and initializing an array, you can include strings, numbers, booleans, and even other arrays */
		var array1 = [1, 2, "Three", "Cat", "Dog", true, false, [10, 11, 12]];
		output.textContent = array1;
		/* STEP 2: Reading and changing array elements
		You can refer to a particular element in an array with it's index number */
		output.textContent = array1[1];
		output.textContent = array1[4];
		// You can also change a particular element
		array1[4] = "Bird";
		console.log(array1);
		// An array within an array is called a multidimensional array - it can be accessed by specifying the index of the first array, then the item within it
		output.textContent = array1[7][0];
		/* STEP 3: Determining array length
		Being able to figure out how many elements are contained in an array is a critical feature of JavaScript programming */
		output.textContent = array1.length;
		output.textContent = array1[7].length;
		// In particular, looping through arrays
		for (let i = 0; i < array1.length; i++) {
			console.log(array1[i]);
		}
		/* STEP 4: Convert a string to an array
		If there is a common character that can act as a delimiter in a string, we can use this character to create an array */
		var myString = "DOG,CAT,BIRD,FISH";
		var newArraySplits = myString.split(",");
		// Output one of the array items
		console.log(newArraySplits);
		// Output the last element of the array
		output.textContent = newArraySplits[newArraySplits.length - 1];
		/* STEP 5: Convert an array back to a string
		Use join() and toString() - note that join() allows you to choose and insert a delimiter, while toString() does not */
		output.textContent = newArraySplits.toString();
		var joinedString = newArraySplits.join(" ~~~ ");
		output.textContent = joinedString;

		/* STEP 6: Adding and removing items from an array
		Without the ability to edit the contents of an array, this type of variable would have limited use - but adding and removing array items is pretty straightforward */

		// Adding one or more items to an array with push()
		var pushedElement = array1.push("Elephant");
		output.textContent = "Pushed Element: " + pushedElement + " for array: " + array1;
		// If you would like to capture how many elements are in the array after you have edited it, then…

		// Removing an item from an array with pop()
		var poppedElement = array1.pop();
		output.textContent = "Popped Element: " + poppedElement + " for array: " + array1;
		// pop() returns the item that was removed, rather than the length of the updated array, so…

		// To do the same thing, that is, to add and remove an item from the beginning of the array, use shift() and unshift()
		var shiftedElement = array1.shift();
		output.textContent = "Shifted Element: " + shiftedElement + " for array: " + array1;

		var unshiftedElement = array1.unshift("Tiger");
		output.textContent = "Length Unshifted Element: " + unshiftedElement + " for array: " + array1;
		/* That's it for the basics of working with arrays! With these tools at your disposal, a whole new world of possibilities with JavaScript are at your command */
